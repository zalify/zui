# Zalify UI

> Beautifully-designed, accessible React component library with embedded CSS and zero-config theming

Zalify UI is a production-ready React component library that ships as a single NPM package. Built on Ark UI (headless components), it provides beautiful, accessible components with embedded CSS — no external style configuration required.

**Website:** https://ui.zalify.com

## What is Zalify UI?

Zalify UI is an NPM component library for React. Install the package, wrap your app with `ZalifyProvider`, and start using components immediately. All styles are embedded — no CSS files, no build plugins, no Panda CSS setup needed by consumers.

### Core Principles

**1. Zero-Config Styling**
- All component CSS is embedded in the package
- No external CSS files or build plugins required
- `ZalifyProvider` injects styles and configures theming
- Works out of the box with any React setup

**2. Composition**
- Built on Ark UI, a headless component library for scalable design systems
- All components share a composable, predictable interface
- Easy to combine and customize without workarounds

**3. Server Component Support**
- Designed for React Server Components architecture
- Non-interactive components work as Server Components
- Interactive components are marked with `'use client'`
- Tree-shakeable exports

**4. Beautiful Design**
- Designed in collaboration with Brains & Pixels
- Minimalistic, clean aesthetic by default
- Consistent styling across all components

**5. AI Ready**
- Consistent API makes it easy for AI tools to work with
- LLMs can read, understand, and generate components
- Seamless integration with existing design systems

## Installation

```bash
npm install @zalify-ui/react
```

### Setup

1. **Wrap your app with ZalifyProvider:**

```tsx
import { ZalifyProvider } from '@zalify-ui/react'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <ZalifyProvider accentColor="jade" grayColor="neutral" borderRadius="md">
          {children}
        </ZalifyProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

2. **Import and use components:**

```tsx
import { Button, Card, Heading } from '@zalify-ui/react'
```

## Theming System

Theming is configured through `ZalifyProvider` props:

### ZalifyProvider Props

- **`accentColor`** - Primary color palette (26 options): neutral, tomato, red, ruby, crimson, pink, plum, purple, violet, iris, indigo, blue, cyan, teal, jade, green, grass, bronze, gold, brown, orange, amber, yellow, lime, mint, sky
- **`grayColor`** - Neutral palette (6 options): neutral, mauve, olive, sage, sand, slate
- **`borderRadius`** - Corner rounding (7 options): none, xs, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl

### Component Sizing

Components are organized into two categories for perfect alignment:

**Primary Components** (core interactive elements)
- Button, Input, Select, etc.
- Sizes: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`

**Secondary Components** (supporting elements)
- Badge, Checkbox, Switch, etc.
- Sizes: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`

Components in the same category and size have identical heights. For example, a `md` Button and `md` Input are both exactly 40px tall.

### Standardized Variants

Five consistent variants across all components:

1. **solid** - High-contrast background with inverted foreground (primary CTAs)
2. **subtle** - Tinted background with matching foreground (badges, tags, selected states)
3. **surface** - Background with visible border and hover states (cards, menu items)
4. **outline** - Border-only with transparent background (secondary actions)
5. **plain** - Minimal style with background on interaction (text buttons, links, tabs)

### Color System

Zalify UI uses **Radix Colors** instead of traditional 50-950 scales:
- 12 shades per color per mode (24 total per color)
- Finer control and greater flexibility
- Optimized for both light and dark modes
- Built around one accent color + one gray color pairing

### Design Tokens

**Border Radius**
- `l1` - Smallest radius (for nested elements)
- `l2` - Medium radius (wraps l1)
- `l3` - Largest radius (wraps l2)

**Shadows**
- Range from `xs` to `2xl`
- Adapt seamlessly to light and dark mode

## Key Technologies

- **Ark UI** - Headless component library (accessibility + behavior)
- **Radix Colors** - Professional color system
- **Lucide Icons** - Default icon library (swappable)
