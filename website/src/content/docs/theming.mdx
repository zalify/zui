Zalify UI theming is configured through `ZalifyProvider` props. The provider injects all component styles and maps your chosen accent color, gray palette, and border radius across the entire component library.

```tsx
import { ZalifyProvider } from '@zalify-ui/react'

<ZalifyProvider accentColor="jade" grayColor="neutral" borderRadius="md">
  {children}
</ZalifyProvider>
```

### Accent Color

The `accentColor` prop sets the primary color palette used across interactive components. Available values:

`neutral` `tomato` `red` `ruby` `crimson` `pink` `plum` `purple` `violet` `iris` `indigo` `blue` `cyan` `teal` `jade` `green` `grass` `bronze` `gold` `brown` `orange` `amber` `yellow` `lime` `mint` `sky`

### Gray Color

The `grayColor` prop sets the neutral palette used for text, borders, and backgrounds. Available values:

`neutral` `mauve` `olive` `sage` `sand` `slate`

### Border Radius

The `borderRadius` prop controls corner rounding globally. Available values:

`none` `xs` `sm` `md` `lg` `xl` `2xl`

## Components

Zalify UI components are designed with consistent sizing and standardized variants to ensure visual harmony across your interface.

### Sizing

Zalify UI organizes component sizing into two categories:

* **Primary components** — core interactive elements that drive user actions (e.g., Buttons, Inputs, Selects).
* **Secondary components** — supporting elements that complement primary interactions (e.g., Badges, Checkboxes, Switches).

This categorization establishes a clear hierarchy and guarantees alignment. Components within the same category share identical heights for a given size token. For example, both a `md` Button and a `md` Input are exactly `40px` tall, ensuring perfect alignment when placed together.

### Variants

Variants are standardized across components for a unified look and feel. Zalify UI defines five shared variants:

* `solid`
* `subtle`
* `surface`
* `outline`
* `plain`

This consistency allows you to combine components without worrying about mismatched styles. Using the same variant across elements guarantees visual harmony.

#### Solid

High-contrast background with inverted foreground. Use for primary CTAs, submit buttons, and main actions.

<VariantPreview variant="solid" />

#### Subtle

Tinted background with matching foreground. Use for badges, tags, selected states, and secondary highlights.

<VariantPreview variant="subtle" />

#### Surface

Background with visible border and hover states. Use for cards, menu items, selectable lists, and elevated containers.

<VariantPreview variant="surface" />

#### Outline

Border-only with transparent background. Use for secondary actions, cancel buttons, filters, and tertiary controls.

<VariantPreview variant="outline" />

#### Plain

Minimal style with background on interaction. Use for text buttons, links, tabs, and ghost actions.

<VariantPreview variant="plain" />

## Colors

Zalify UI's color system is built on [Radix Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors). Each color comes with 12 shades per mode (light and dark), for a total of 24 shades.

### Gray

### Accent

### Pairings

Zalify UI is built around the concept of one accent color and one gray color. Configure which combination works best for you via the `ZalifyProvider` props.

#### Neutral Pairings

If you want a neutral vibe, or you want to keep things simple, `neutral` will work well with any hue or palette.

#### Natural pairing

Alternatively, choose the gray scale which is saturated with the hue closest to your accent hue. The difference is subtle, but this will create a more colorful and harmonious vibe.

## Tokens

### Border Radius

Radii tokens define consistent corner rounding across components. This setup makes it easy to nest border radii as shown below.

* **`l1`** – smallest radius, used inside other elements
* **`l2`** – medium radius, used when wrapping `l1`
* **`l3`** – largest radius, used when wrapping `l2`

### Shadows

Shadows provide consistent elevation levels, from `xs` to `2xl`. They adapt seamlessly to both light and dark mode.
