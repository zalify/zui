You've been there: You install a popular UI component library, everything works great - until you need to set up the styling system. Suddenly, you're installing CSS plugins, configuring PostCSS, importing global stylesheets, and wrestling with build tools just to get your first component on screen.

Zalify UI takes a different approach. Install a single package, wrap your app with a provider, and every component is styled automatically — no CSS files, no build plugins, no configuration.

## Zero-Config by Design

Zalify UI ships all component styles embedded directly in the package. The `ZalifyProvider` component injects styles and configures theming through simple props:

```tsx
<ZalifyProvider accentColor="jade" grayColor="neutral" borderRadius="md">
  {children}
</ZalifyProvider>
```

Choose from 26 accent colors, 6 gray palettes, and 7 border radius levels. Your entire design system is configured in a single line — no theme files, no token configuration, no build steps.

## Built on Battle-Tested Foundations

Zalify UI isn't built from scratch. It's built on Ark UI, which provides accessible component logic. Ark UI handles complex interactions like modals, dropdowns, and date pickers with a composable architecture. The predictable API works great for both developers and AI tools.

The result? You get accessibility and interaction logic from Ark UI, beautiful default styling from Zalify UI, and a consistent component API across your entire application.

## Beautiful by Default

Developed in collaboration with Brains & Pixels, Zalify UI provides a systematic design approach that looks professional out of the box.

Component sizing is consistent across the board. Primary components like buttons and inputs share heights per size token. For example, a medium button and medium input are both exactly 40px tall. Secondary components like badges and checkboxes align perfectly alongside them.

Five standardized variants work across all components: solid for high-contrast CTAs, subtle for badges and tags, surface for cards and containers, outline for secondary actions, and plain for text buttons and links. This guarantees visual harmony when mixing components.

The advanced color system built on Radix Colors provides 12 shades per mode with light and dark mode support out of the box. You get more flexibility than traditional 11-shade scales with natural color pairings for harmonious UIs.

Zalify UI also includes thoughtful design tokens like nested border radius values (l1, l2, l3) and adaptive shadows that work in both light and dark modes.

## Server Components First

Zalify UI is designed for the React Server Components architecture. Components that don't need interactivity — like `Heading`, `Text`, `Badge`, and `Code` — work as Server Components out of the box. Interactive components are properly marked with `'use client'` directives. This means less JavaScript shipped to the browser and faster page loads.

## Developer Experience That Scales

Getting started takes under a minute:

```bash
npm install @zalify-ui/react
```

Add the provider to your layout, import components, and start building. No CLI commands, no codegen, no Panda CSS configuration. Because it's a standard NPM package, upgrades are straightforward and your tooling works as expected.

The AI-enhanced workflow is particularly powerful. Components have a consistent, predictable API that LLMs can easily understand. AI tools can generate new UIs that integrate seamlessly with your existing Zalify UI components.

## When Should You Use Zalify UI?

Zalify UI is perfect for React projects that want beautiful defaults without configuration overhead, teams building applications that need consistent design, and developers who want Server Component support out of the box. If accessibility is non-negotiable or you're embracing AI-assisted development, Zalify UI is an excellent choice.

## Getting Started

Getting started with Zalify UI takes just minutes. Install the package, wrap your app with `ZalifyProvider`, and import components. That's it.

## A Better Component Library Experience

Zalify UI provides a clean, zero-configuration experience without sacrificing quality or flexibility. Beautiful defaults, consistent APIs, embedded styling, and Server Component support — everything you need to build production applications with confidence.
